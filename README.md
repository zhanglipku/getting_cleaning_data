If you download the UCI HAR Dataset file, unzip it and set the working directory to .\UCI HAR Dataset
This folder includes the following files:
1. An annotated R script that does the following:
   -- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   -- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
   -- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   -- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
   -- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. The new dataset is stored in the file: final.csv
3. a codebook is included to explain different variables.
4. a readme file, which you have been reading so far.
